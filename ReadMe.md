## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

This repository contains some basic Python utilities for
matrix operations. This is also the repository where
you will submit the assignment.

Once completed the repository should contain your code,
a short report, and any instructions needed to run your
code.

###Intructions:

You may create a matrix by using the genMatrix method, or
by performing a matrix multiplication.

If you would like to create a matrix by performing a
matrix multiplication, raise the flag -m or
--multiplication and pass the name of the files where the
two matrices to be multiplied are located. You may use
the tile algorithm by raising the -a or --alternative
flag (optional).

If you would like to create a matrix by using the
genMatrix method, simply omit the -m flag. The values and
size of the matrix may be specified using the -v and -s
flags, respectively (optional).

In either case, if you would like to save the matrix just
created, use the -f or --filename flags and specify the
name of the file where the matrix is to be saved 
(optional).
