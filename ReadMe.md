## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

This repository contains some basic Python utilities for
matrix operations. This is also the repository where
you will submit the assignment.

Once completed the repository should contain your code,
a short report, and any instructions needed to run your
code.

Use options -v or -s if you would like to create a
matrix of the specified size and value. Integers may
be entered to denote the value of the values (-v) and
size (-s) in the matrix.

Use option -m if you would like to multiply two matrices
and obtain their result. The names of the two files from
which the matrices will be read must be specified.

Use option -f if you would like to write the resulting
matrix in either case. The name of the file to which the
matrix will be written must be specified.
